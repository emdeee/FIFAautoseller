# FIFAautoseller

This is a very small programm aimed at FIFA players who mass invest into players and then sell them on the FIFA Web App.

Important Notes: This only works on a monitor with 1920x1080 resolution. Open your browser full screened else this programm will do more harm than good!
Also, do not use the mouse while this script is working because that will cause it to fail!
Lastly, if you have a  dual(or more) monitor setup, make sure to open the browser window on the main monitor. 
HF investing people!

How does it work:
1. Open the file and set your desired parameters:  
- Amount (of players you  want to list (max 50))
- Starting price of the players
- Buy now price of  the players
2. Save the file
3. Open the unassigned pile in the web app where you can see the unassigned players
4. Run the Programm 
5. Profit???
