# FIFAautoseller

This is a very small programm aimed at FIFA players who mass invest into players and then sell them on the FIFA Web App.

Important Notes: This only works on a monitor with 1920x1080 resolution. Open your browser full screened else this programm will do more harm than good!
Also, do not use the mouse while this script is working because that will cause it to fail!
Lastly, if you have a  dual(or more) monitor setup, make sure to open the browser window on the main monitor. 
HF investing people!

How does it work:
You run the script and it will prompt you to enter the three following values:
1. Starting price of your players
2. Buy now price of your players
3. Amount of players you want to sell (Should not be above 50 because the unassigned pile only shows your next 50 Items. Note: I did not cap this on purpose because
technically you can also sell your players on the transfer list with this script and I think every expirienced Investor knows about the 50 players per round limit)
                  
Final Update: 
The program now generates random waiting times between each action to properly immitate human movement. 
This way it will be impossible for EA to detect the script running
